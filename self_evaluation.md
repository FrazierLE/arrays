1. How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
I feel fairly confident with what's been presented to us thus far. I ran my arrays.js code in replit after to make sure it worked and it worked with the first try.
1. Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
I think just practicing it to make it feel more comfortable. I don't know if I necessarily need to be deep diving into google, but just practicing should help.
